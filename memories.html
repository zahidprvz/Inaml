            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all began on January 24, 2023, when I first spoke to a girl who has since captured my heart. I had admired her from afar since my third semester, but it was only in my fifth semester that I mustered the courage to express my feelings.

            <h2>About Inaml</h2>
            <p>
                Her name is Inaml, and she is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry at our university. In my third semester, I contemplated leaving my Computer Science degree due to various challenges I faced. However, one day, I caught a glimpse of her at the bus stop. At first, she seemed youthful and hurried, her presence striking a chord within me.

                Dressed in a black abaya, her face was radiant with a hint of pink, complemented by a small sheen of perspiration on her forehead. I was captivated by her black hair and expressive eyes. Even though she was with friends, I felt an undeniable connection that drove me to learn more about her.
